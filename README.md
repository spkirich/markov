# Markov

A minimalistic LaTeX presentation class

## Usage

Just clone the repo:

``` bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/spkirich/markov.git
```

Then edit `slides.tex`.
It is also quite easy to build a PDF file:

``` bash
make
```

And now you have your `slides.pdf` eventually!

## Acknowledgements

This class is inspired by some beautiful slides of [Antonina
Nepeivoda](https://github.com/TonitaN).
